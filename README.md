Candyland
=========

These are custom candy plugins I wrote for a project.

## Require Candy 1.6.0+

### lazy-login-form
Overides the default login form and fills in the domain part of the JID before authentication. Happy users...

### role-colors
Detects the **role** and **affiliation** of senders and applies CSS tags to their messages so you can change the style.

## Require Candy Chat Dev Branch

### spark-room-invites
> Requires the **dev** branch of candy-chat/candy.

Detects room invites from .Spark/Openfire and prompt/joins the user to the new room.

* Can auto join users.
* Can prompt users in all their chat windows.
* Invitations can expire after set time period.
* Users do not need to know room passwords.
